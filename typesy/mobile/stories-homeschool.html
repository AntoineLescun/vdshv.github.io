                                Typesy gives students a more challenging typing experience than what we were previously using. There is lots of practice that helps to cement the key locations into the mind.

                                We used Typesy for the first time this year. The students enjoyed the program and liked being able to access it from any device. As the instructor, I like the videos and the visual assistance of the keyboard strokes below the practice pages.

                                Typesy has been used at our college for nearly 2 years for our Secretarial students. The students do really well in developing their touch typing techniques and speed. The support received from eReflect has been very quick. A great product and a great team.

                                We used Typesy for the first time in the 2015-2016 school year. It is a great program because it provides flexibility for the students to work at their own pace. Students who already had good typing skills were able to increase speed and accuracy.

                                I love Typesy because my students can come into the lab each week and very easily complete a lesson, and I can just as easily pull reports to track their progress. I also like that my students can use it at home or school. The students love it because they can pick up where they left off last class, it gives tutorials, and they love to play the games.

                                It goes without saying that this is probably one of the best pieces of software to improve your typing skills. The software is incredibly easy to use and navigate and the content is truly vast.

                                Typesy is one of the BEST keyboarding program around! My students find it easy to use and navigate through.

                                It's working out alright, the students' typing skills are developing. I like the courses, the layout is easy for them to understand, a lot of them really enjoy the games.

                                I’m just grateful that I’m getting such good feedback from the students -3rd grade and middle school – they are all communicating with me and say they love Typesy, compared to Mavis Beacon. Typesy is very intuitive for them.

                                Typesy has helped our students become more familiar with the keyboard and typing and it has proved to help them be more efficient in sharing their ideas! The customer service is very friendly and quickly resolves any issues! We are adding the program to our grade 3-5 building as well!

                                Typesy is one of the best programs we’ve found for working with all of our different groups. Right now, homeless veterans, special needs adults, and underemployed or unemployed individuals are all using Typesy to increase their typing speeds and accuracy for employment, training, and education.
