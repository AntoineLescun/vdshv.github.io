					<h2>Terms / Conditions:</h2>
					
					<p>Magical Unicorn Coalition is an Ethereum blockchain-based generative project consisting of 10,000 unique Magical Unicorn avatar’s displaying randomized traits. The Magical Unicorn Coalition team are existing business owners with a passion for quality art and community building. These terms of service (“TOS”) are intended to provide clear, transparent guidelines for responsible ownership and use of Magical Unicorn Coalition. Any questions can be sent along to the Creative Team, via Twitter or DiscoV.</p>

					<h3>Ownership and Commercial Rights of Magical Unicorn Coalition NFT’s</h3>

					<p>Magical Unicorn Coalition’s consists of 10,000 individual ERC-721 tokens (individually “Magical Unicorns”, collectively “Magical Unicorn Coalition” or “NFTs”) which include unique generative artwork hosted on AWS and IPFS). By minting a Magical Unicorn Coalition NFT from our smart contract, purchasing it off the secondary market (e.g. OpenSea), or otherwise acquiring the Magical Unicorn Coalition through any other legitimate means or method, the Holder receives full and complete ownership, inclusive of commercial rights, to the NFT and the corresponding unique artwork. The License the Holder is receiving is solely for the Licensed NFT Magical Unicorn Coalition which includes the right to use the Licensed NFT Magical Unicorn Coalition and the right to reproduce the Licensed NFT Magical Unicorn Coalition on tribute or derivative art, merchandise, or sharing these rights with third party projects. The Holder agrees not to use, utilize, portray, advertise, distribute or otherwise market any Magical Unicorn Coalition in any project or derivative work that involves hate speech, racism, pornography, or any other illegal or unlawful content. Upon sale or transfer of the NFT, any ownership or commercial rights are immediately transferred to the new Holder. No refunds shall be issued to any Holder upon a full and complete lawful purchase of any NFT or Magical Unicorn Coalition. In the event that any Holder purchases a Magical Unicorn Coalition through the secondary market, such as OpenSea, Holder shall be held accountable and will be bound by the Terms of Service which govern said secondary market platform.</p>


					<h3>Limitations of Liability for Gas, Failed Transactions, Smart Contract Bugs</h3>

					<p>Participants in minting Magical Unicorn Coalition NFTs agree not to hold the project’s Creative Team for any losses incurred as a consequence of minting an NFT. These potential losses include any gas fees for failed transactions, any excessive gas fees charged due to website or smart contract bugs, and any loss of any NFT due to website or smart contract bugs.</p>


					<h3>No Guarantees or Future Promises</h3>

					<p>While Magical Unicorn Coalition has released a roadmap outlining future goals and plans for community development, we cannot guarantee to accomplish every item outlined during the pre-launch planning phase as ideas and projects evolve organically. You agree that your purchase of a Magical Unicorn Coalition from our initial launch of 10,000 NFTs is all you are guaranteed to receive with your initial purchase, whether through primary or secondary channels. Any future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be taken into  consideration with your initial purchase. You agree that you are not relying on any future commitments by Magical Unicorn Coalition in using this site and participating in our NFT launch.</p>

					<h3>No Guarantees of Value</h3>

					<p>Magical Unicorn Coalition NFTs were created purely as collectibles, not as investment vehicles or substitutes for cryptocurrency. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will subsequently retain monetary value in fiat, cash or cryptocurrency.</p>

					<h3>Taxes</h3>

					<p>Each Holder is solely and entirely responsible for any and all Federal or State tax liabilities which may arise, be imposed, or enforced as a result of minting or reselling Magical Unicorn Coalition.</p>

					<h3>Class Action Waiver, Jurisdiction and Choice of Law</h3>

					<p>You agree to waive any class action status, and any legal dispute around the Magical Unicorn Coalition project which you may choose to bring can only be done on an individual basis.</p>

					<h3>Children</h3>

					<p>The Magical Unicorn Coalition project is not targeted towards children. You agree that you are over the age of 18, or above the legal age of your jurisdiction, whichever is greater. Any individual under the age of 18 participating in this project should only do so under parental supervision.</p>

					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

					<p>Magical Unicorn Coalition will not collect any cookies, IP addresses, or user data in connection with your use of the website and app, with the exception of cookies related to browsing behavior for the Google analytics SEO which helps us enhance your experience with our site and relay visitor traffic statistics to the Google search engine. All project participants understand that the Ethereum blockchain network is a public blockchain, and all transaction history initiated through the website will be made public. Magical Unicorn Coalition has no influence on secondary marketplaces, such as OpenSea which have independent terms of service agreed to by you, should you choose to utilize these sites. You also understand that Magical Unicorn Coalition may work with third-party apps, such as Discord or Collab.Land, which collect and store user data. Should Simp Mermaids be required to collect or store data for future activities such as merchandise launches or transfer of any benefits such as airdrops, you will be required to agree to the collection of this data. This provision may be subject to change, when deemed fit by the Magical Unicorn Coalition team.</p>
