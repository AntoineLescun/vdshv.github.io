					<div>
						<h5>Green-Lipped Mussels</h5>
						<p>Green-lipped mussels are a safe, effective alternative to NSAIDs. They're rich in fatty acids, a natural anti-inflammatory, and critical for dogs who experience joint pain from arthritis.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)</h5>
						<p>MSM is an organic form of sulfur that helps block the inflammation process, improve the uptake of key nutrients, inactivate harmful free radicals, and reduce pain.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Glucosamine</h5>
						<p>Glucosamine is a building block of cartilage and stimulates growth of cartilage cells, as well as lubricates joints. Dogs produce glucosamine themselves, but over time the production becomes insufficient to prevent joint issues and they require supplementation.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Chondroitin</h5>
						<p>Chondroitin promotes water retention and elasticity, which are critical to joint mobility. Research shows that combining chondroitin with glucosamine results in reduced pain and arthritis severity in dogs.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Manganese</h5>
						<p>Manganese deficiency is a common cause of joint pain and arthritis in dogs. It helps with the production of cartilage and supports good muscle and bone health—both of which are important for the maintenance of health joints.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)</h5>
						<p>Vitamin C helps maintain the health of collagen and research suggests it's key for helping to slow degenerative joint disease. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and helps boost the immune system, as well.</p>
