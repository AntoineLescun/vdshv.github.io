Beware, some of them are well mannered, some are real killers. You can capture up to 20 CryptoClowns at a time on October 25th, to do your part in preventing these psychos from wreaking havoc on society!

					<div>
						<p>A virus has escaped from a research facility in China and is
							now infecting the entire world.  The effects of this virus are
							uncommon... If you are contaminated, your skin will start
							turning a pale white and your hair will become colourful
							turning into a bright yellow, purple or even greenish color!
							Your blood will coagulate at your body’s extremities and
							your nose will become reddish... You will also feel the urge
							to eat human flesh & blood. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							As the virus spreads through the world population, society
							becomes chaotic, essential services are stopped and buildings
							start to crumble. Simple ressources like food & water are now
							as scarce as gold. Also, the infected, are roaming around in
							search of fresh humans everywhere. Survivors call these
							infected people Clowns, as they literally look like Psychotic
							Clowns. In order to survive, the non-infected have no choice
							but to dress up as Clowns... trying to fool the infected ones... 
						</p>	
						<p>	
							Looting the best ressources, weapons, food & drinks is a must!
							Build your secret hideout, set up your defences,  find & craft
							better weapons and level up your character for your best
							chances at survival and at saving what is left of the human race.
							Do everything you can to get an edge in this chaotic clown world.
							But no matter what... do not get  eaten or bitten by these infected
							deranged Clowns or you will yourself become one of them.
						</p>
						<p>
							How long can you survive in this
							Dystopian World of Good & Evil Clowns...?
